# SurveyTracker

Temporal tracking of all surveys done in Simcoe county by Rudy Mak Surveying Ltd, which will allow the survey crew to view the due dates of active and upcoming jobs, to make conscientious scheduling decisions.

This web map was designed to allow users to view all the surveys done in Simcoe county by the Rudy Mak Surveying Ltd. With these tools, the staff of the RMS will be able to track surveys based on their due dates, to see which jobs are active and determine which ones to prioritize.
The addresses of each job were geocoded to the Simcoe County road network, using ArcGIS Pro from a csv file format, then layers were shared to AGOL as web layers.
This web map was then generated from the published web layers.
Web layers:
-Active Jobs by Date
-Active Jobs by Type
-Simcoe County Road Network
Simcoe County Boundary
